# SMYLD Portal Engine
Portal Engine is establishing a compelete segregation between GUI layer and other modules of the software, the target is to eleminate the boilerplate code and to alleviates dealing with GUI components. The framework was originally designed to deal with Swing Components back in 2004, was successfully used with many applications which saved considerable time.

### Swing! are you serious? in 2019!
Well you are right, many alternatives are available but do not forget some facts:

#### 1 - Multi-threading 
#### 2 - Performance
#### 3 - Intellij

**Intellij !** ... YES! one of the most powerful editors in the market is still written with Swing. However Jet Brains holds also a powerful development team. Still, it is written in Swing.

**What about Java FX!** Well, till now, the performance is still on the side of Swing.


**However this is not only about Swing!**
